# Github Profiles

https://thedanitor.github.io/github_profiles/

This project is from the Day 28 code along video from Udemy's 50 projects in 50 days series focused on web development. I have added some comments to the CSS and JavaScript to make notes to myself why certain choices are being made and what particular lines of code do.

### Overall Impression

Good refresher on Axios and getting API data. Also nice that I didn't need an API key! I could see something like this being useful for any kind of directory.

### Things Learned

* Axios already formats res into res.json()
